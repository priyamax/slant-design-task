                 <p class="vsc1">There's more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than focusing or block style information architecture. you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautifuk photography, that act as a continuum. ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page.</p>

                 <p class="vsc123">Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It's now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping. Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation, providing a responsive, use-friendly experience for mobile users.

                 <p class="vsc125">These days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page requires thought and motivation. A single page website allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker than needing to sift through multi pages.

                 <p class="vsc126">One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of 
                    pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results page (SERP). Luckily there are 
                    ways around it.</p>

                <div class="container  col-xl-5 col-sm-7 col-md-6 col-lg-5 text-start" >
                 <p class="vsc127">50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the more high resolution imagery and animations you include,the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took upto 30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites loaded within a few seconds.

                 <p class="vsc128">Instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is to include top navigation and have each element anchored to a category or section.
